These sites are separated into two main groups, terrestrial and aquatic, and the aquatic sites are further subdivided into lakes, rivers, and wadable streams. Each of these different site types have different instrumentation and observation configurations, so not every data product is available at every site. We can start by asking what kinds of data products are available for a given site. This is done by using the sites/ endpoint in the API; this endpoint is used for getting information about specific NEON field sites. In this example we will query which data products are available at the Lower Teakettle (TEAK) site."
